# Mastermind Game

This is a command line implementation of the classic code-guessing game :)

## **Running the Game**

### **Option 1: Run Remotely**
Use [Replit.com]((https://replit.com/)):
1. Create a new App
2. Select `Import from GitHub`, then enter this project's URL (https://github.com/j542yu/mastermind-game)
3. Once the App is created, navigate to the .replit file from the left side bar and add this to line 2:
   ```bash
   run = ["sh", "-c", "bundle install && bundle exec ruby main.rb"]
   ```
4. Click `Run` at the top to begin playing!

### **Option 2: Run Locally**
1. **Install Ruby**: Follow the official installation guide [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).
This implementation is written in Ruby version 3.3.5.
2. **Clone the Repository**:
   * [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) this repository.
   * [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) your forked repo to your local machine.
3. **Install Dependencies**:
   * Navigate to the project directory.
   * Install the required gems by running
      ```bash
      ~$ bundle install
      ```
4. **Start the Game**:
   * Launch the game by running
      ```bash
      ~$ ruby main.rb
      ```

## **How to Play**

Mastermind is a classic code-breaking game where one player creates a secret code, and the other player tries to guess it within a limited number of attempts.

### **Game Rules**
1. The **codemaker** creates a secret four-letter code using six possible letters (each representing a color in the physical game).
2. The **codebreaker** has a set number of attempts to guess the code.
3. After each guess, the codemaker provides feedback:
   * **Black Pegs**: Correct letter in the correct position.
   * **White Pegs**: Correct letter but in the wrong position.
4. The codebreaker uses this feedback to refine their guesses and crack the code.

When you run the game, follow the on-screen instructions which will guide you through.

## **Computer Logic**

If you choose to be the codemaker, the computer will use the Swaszek algorithm to guess your secret code in an average of five guesses.  
Pretty cool :')
